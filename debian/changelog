mlat-client (0.1.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Remove --byteswap-timestamp option: the timestamps generated by a
    big-endian dump1090 are irretrievably broken.
  * Futureproofing: add support for "split sync" sync message
  * Futureproofing: add a sequence number to the UDP header, bump UDP version
  * Futureproofing: restructure the heartbeat message so more fields can be
    added later
  * Add support for ECEF-style return results.

mlat-client (0.1.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Raise better exceptions on input error to try to diagnose Radarcape problems.
  * Handle (and skip) the mystery '4' message that Radarcape systems generate.
  * Add --byteswap-timestamp for dealing with dump1090s that (incorrectly)
    generate little-endian timestamp values.
  * Use the normal reconnect delay when reconnecting after a timestamp problem is
    seen.
  * Don't forward DF17 sync messages with NUC<6.
  * Use UDP transport for mlat/sync messages if requested by the server. Can
    be disabled with --no-udp.
  * Send ADS-B position rate reports if requested by the server.

  * Ignore heartbeat messages with a zero timestamp.
  * Expire all current aircraft state if the input connetion is lost.
  * Handle connection errors a bit more reliably.
